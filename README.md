# tRPC-learn

The tRPC-learn repository holds my initial experiments with tRPC protocol. My goal is to document my adventures as I learn the basics of the language.

tRPC stands for TypeScript Remote Procedure Call, and is the most simple and lightweight library for remotely calling backend functions on the client side. It aims to provide developers with the experience of TypeScript inference to make communication between the backend and frontend more productive.

It allows sharing of types between the client and server and just imports the types and not the actual server code, so none of the server code is exposed in the frontend.

## Configuration

1. Install `npm` on your operative system.

## Installation

1. Install all dependencies using `npm`.

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Development

To activate both services (frontend / backend) you should run:

```sh
$ npm run start
```
